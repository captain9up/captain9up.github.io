  <b></b><br>In my works, I tend to focus on creating new trend, the evolution of combing hyper real photographs and animation. I likes to use a lot visual effects and graphic designs as obviously. Glitch art is one of my favorite way of presenting. I usually use GLITCHATRON to create my glitch art as basis, and combing with Photoshop as developing tool. Digital art might be my biggest examination of the relationship between the digital and physical world.

I creates an interplay between digital, culture and reality. My works ask not just what humans are doing with media, but what media is doing with humans. The connection between past and present, community and individual, younger and elder.
